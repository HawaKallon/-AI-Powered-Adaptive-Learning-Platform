# Curriculum Topics and Subtopics Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive system that uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to retrieve topics and subtopics from the Sierra Leone curriculum when a subject/grade is selected. This system provides students with structured access to curriculum content and enables them to explore topics before requesting lessons.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Curriculum Service (`curriculum_ingestion.py`)
Added three new methods to the `CurriculumIngestionService`:

#### `get_curriculum_topics_and_subtopics(subject, grade, db)`
- Queries curriculum embeddings from the database
- Groups content by topics and collects subtopics
- Extracts brief descriptions using RAG
- Returns structured topic data with subtopics and descriptions

#### `get_topic_details(subject, topic, grade, db)`
- Retrieves detailed information about a specific topic
- Uses both direct database queries and RAG semantic search
- Extracts learning objectives, key concepts, and content previews
- Provides comprehensive topic information for lesson generation

#### `_extract_learning_objectives(content, topic)`
- Parses curriculum content to identify learning objectives
- Looks for objective patterns like "learn to", "understand", "able to"
- Extracts structured learning goals from curriculum text

#### `_extract_key_concepts_from_content(content, topic)`
- Identifies key concepts from curriculum content
- Extracts bulleted lists and important statements
- Provides structured concept lists for learning

### 2. New API Endpoints (`lessons.py`)
Added three new REST endpoints:

#### `GET /lessons/curriculum/topics`
- Parameters: `subject`, `grade`
- Returns: List of topics with subtopics and descriptions
- Uses RAG to structure curriculum content

#### `GET /lessons/curriculum/topic/{topic}`
- Parameters: `topic`, `subject`, `grade`
- Returns: Detailed topic information including objectives and key concepts
- Provides comprehensive topic analysis

#### `GET /lessons/curriculum/search`
- Parameters: `query`, `subject`, `grade`, `n_results`
- Returns: Search results from curriculum content
- Enables semantic search through curriculum

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. CurriculumTopics Component (`CurriculumTopics.jsx`)
A comprehensive React component that provides:

#### Features:
- **Topic Browser**: Displays all available topics for a subject/grade
- **Search Functionality**: Filter topics and subtopics by search query
- **Expandable Topics**: Click to expand and view subtopics
- **Topic Details**: Detailed view with objectives, key concepts, and content preview
- **Interactive Selection**: Click topics/subtopics to select them for lessons

#### UI Elements:
- Search bar for filtering topics
- Expandable topic cards with descriptions
- Subtopic lists with clickable items
- Detailed topic information panel
- "Start Learning" action button

### 2. Updated StudentDashboard (`StudentDashboard.jsx`)
Enhanced the student dashboard with:

#### New Curriculum Tab:
- Added "Curriculum" tab to the navigation
- Integrated CurriculumTopics component
- Automatic topic selection flow to lesson generation
- Seamless integration with existing lesson request system

### 3. Enhanced API Service (`api.js`)
Added new API methods:

#### `getCurriculumTopics(subject, grade)`
- Fetches topics and subtopics from curriculum

#### `getTopicDetails(topic, subject, grade)`
- Retrieves detailed topic information

#### `searchCurriculum(query, subject, grade, nResults)`
- Performs semantic search through curriculum content

## How It Works

### 1. Topic Discovery Flow:
1. Student selects a subject (Mathematics, English, Science)
2. System queries curriculum embeddings for that subject/grade
3. RAG extracts and structures topics with subtopics
4. Student can browse, search, and explore topics
5. Clicking a topic shows detailed information
6. Student can select topic to generate a lesson

### 2. RAG Integration:
- Uses existing ChromaDB embeddings for semantic search
- Leverages database queries for fast topic retrieval
- Extracts structured information from curriculum content
- Provides contextual Sierra Leone-specific content

### 3. User Experience:
- **Browse**: Students can explore all available topics
- **Search**: Filter topics by keywords
- **Explore**: View detailed topic information
- **Learn**: Select topics to generate personalized lessons

## Testing Results

The system was tested with existing curriculum data:
- **138 curriculum embeddings** available in database
- **3 subjects**: Mathematics, English, Science
- **6 grades**: 7-12
- **Multiple topics per subject** with structured subtopics

### Test Results:
- ✅ Successfully retrieved topics for all subjects
- ✅ Extracted subtopics and descriptions
- ✅ Generated detailed topic information
- ✅ Semantic search functionality working
- ✅ Frontend integration complete

## Benefits

### For Students:
1. **Structured Learning Path**: Clear view of curriculum topics
2. **Informed Selection**: Detailed topic information before learning
3. **Search Capability**: Find specific topics quickly
4. **Contextual Content**: Sierra Leone-specific curriculum content

### For Teachers:
1. **Curriculum Visibility**: Clear view of available topics
2. **Structured Content**: Organized curriculum information
3. **Student Guidance**: Help students choose appropriate topics

### For the System:
1. **RAG Integration**: Leverages existing embedding infrastructure
2. **Fast Performance**: Database queries with semantic search fallback
3. **Scalable**: Works with any curriculum content in the database
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new subjects and grades

## Next Steps

The system is now ready for students to:
1. Explore curriculum topics by subject and grade
2. Search for specific topics or concepts
3. View detailed topic information
4. Select topics to generate personalized lessons
5. Learn with Sierra Leone-specific curriculum content

This implementation provides a solid foundation for curriculum exploration and topic-based learning in the adaptive learning platform.
